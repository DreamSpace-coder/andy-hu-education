## Join Logic

Illustration of common join types:

-   inner join
-   left join
-   right join
-   outer join
-   union ("stacking")
- full (outer) join 

*Note: full join is not available for all SQL dialects. It is a combination of left join + union + right join*

![SQL Join Types](Pictures/sqlJoins_7.png) [Source](https://www.atlassian.com/data/sql/sql-join-types-explained-visually)

Some other join types:

- (Left) Semi-Join: returns only rows in the left table that *have matching rows* in the right table
- (Left) Anti-Join:  returns rows in the left table that *have no matching rows* in the right table

**Note:**

- Semi-join and Anti-join don't bring any additional fields from other tables.
- Semi-join and Anti-join  are not covered in details here, because MySQL doesn't have native implementation for these join types.

## Inner Join

tables overview

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM invoices
ORDER BY invoice_number
LIMIT 10
```

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM vendors 
ORDER BY vendor_name
LIMIT 10
```

Explicit (INNER JOIN)

```{sql}
SELECT invoice_number, vendor_name
FROM vendors INNER JOIN invoices
    ON vendors.vendor_id = invoices.vendor_id
ORDER BY invoice_number
LIMIT 10
```

Compare to the above:

-   table aliases now used
-   just JOIN, instead of full INNER JOIN, now used

```{sql}
SELECT invoice_number, vendor_name, invoice_due_date,
    invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total
    AS balance_due
FROM vendors v JOIN invoices i
    ON v.vendor_id = i.vendor_id
WHERE invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total > 0
ORDER BY invoice_due_date DESC
```

Compare to the above:

-   alias now refers to a table from a different database

```{sql}
SELECT vendor_name, customer_last_name,
    customer_first_name, vendor_state AS state,
    vendor_city AS city
FROM vendors v
    JOIN om.customers c
    ON v.vendor_zip_code = c.customer_zip
ORDER BY state, city
```

Implicit joins (WHERE clause instead of ON clause)

```{sql}
SELECT invoice_number, vendor_name
FROM vendors v, invoices i
WHERE v.vendor_id = i.vendor_id
ORDER BY invoice_number
LIMIT 10
```

Implicit joins with (USING keyword), results identical as the above.

```{sql}
SELECT invoice_number, vendor_name
FROM vendors 
    JOIN invoices USING (vendor_id)
ORDER BY invoice_number
```

Implicit joins with (USING keyword), results identical as the above.

-   use inner join
-   use columns of same names from the tables
-   MySQL, yes, but not for all SQL dialects

```{sql}
SELECT invoice_number, vendor_name
FROM vendors 
    NATURAL JOIN invoices
ORDER BY invoice_number
```

Join on multiple columns ("combo join", join based on combination of columns/keys)

table customers overview:

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM om.customers
```

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM ex.employees
```

-   "Are there any customers and employees with the same first and last name?"

```{sql}
SELECT customer_first_name, customer_last_name
FROM om.customers c INNER JOIN ex.employees e 
    ON c.customer_first_name = e.first_name 
   AND c.customer_last_name = e.last_name
```

### A Somewhat Special Example - Self Join

To make self-join work:

-   must use alias to avoid recycling same table reference

-   "In those cities where more than 1 vendors reside, what are the OTHER vendors that in the same city and state?"


Explore the vendor table:

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM vendors v1
ORDER BY v1.vendor_id, v1.vendor_state, v1.vendor_city
```


Step 1: simple self-joining based on city and state of vendor
```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM vendors v1 INNER JOIN vendors v2
    ON v1.vendor_city = v2.vendor_city AND
       v1.vendor_state = v2.vendor_state
ORDER BY v1.vendor_id, v1.vendor_state, v1.vendor_city
```
Unequal join to remove the vendor itself, so that the rest of the vendors are left in the result:
```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM vendors v1 INNER JOIN vendors v2
    ON v1.vendor_city = v2.vendor_city AND
       v1.vendor_state = v2.vendor_state AND
       v1.vendor_name <> v2.vendor_name
ORDER BY v1.vendor_id, v1.vendor_state, v1.vendor_city
```
Take distinct values of what's left in the "left table". These are the other vendors in the same cities and states.
```{sql}
SELECT DISTINCT v1.vendor_name, v1.vendor_city, 
    v1.vendor_state
FROM vendors v1 INNER JOIN vendors v2
    ON v1.vendor_city = v2.vendor_city AND
       v1.vendor_state = v2.vendor_state AND
       v1.vendor_name <> v2.vendor_name
ORDER BY v1.vendor_state, v1.vendor_city
```

## Outer Join

This includes:

-   left join
-   right join
-   full outer join

tables overview

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM ex.departments
LIMIT 10
```

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM ex.employees 
LIMIT 10
```

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM ex.projects 
LIMIT 10
```

### Left Join

```{sql}
SELECT department_name, last_name, project_number
FROM ex.departments d
    LEFT JOIN ex.employees e
        ON d.department_number = e.department_number
    LEFT JOIN ex.projects p
        ON e.employee_id = p.employee_id
ORDER BY department_name, last_name
```

### Right Join

```{sql}
SELECT department_name, e.department_number, last_name
FROM ex.departments d 
    RIGHT JOIN ex.employees e
    ON d.department_number = e.department_number
ORDER BY department_name
```

combine different join types:

```{sql}
SELECT department_name, last_name, project_number
FROM ex.departments d
    INNER JOIN ex.employees e
        ON d.department_number = e.department_number
    LEFT JOIN ex.projects p
        ON e.employee_id = p.employee_id
ORDER BY department_name, last_name
```

### Cross Join

It creates all combinations of rows from different tables.

tables overview:

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM ex.departments
LIMIT 10
```

```{sql}
SELECT *
FROM ex.employees 
LIMIT 10
```

cross join:

```{sql}
SELECT departments.department_number, department_name,
    employee_id, last_name
FROM ex.departments CROSS JOIN ex.employees
ORDER BY departments.department_number
```

### Union

This is essentially stacking different intermediate table results one on top of another: 

- Each result set must return the same number of columns. 
- The corresponding columns in each result set must have compatible data types. 
- The column names in the final result set are taken from the first SELECT clause.

```{sql}
SELECT 'Active' AS source, 
  invoice_number, 
  invoice_date, 
  invoice_total
FROM ex.active_invoices
WHERE invoice_date >= '2022-06-01'

UNION

SELECT 'Paid' AS source, 
  invoice_number, 
  invoice_date, 
  invoice_total
FROM ex.paid_invoices
WHERE invoice_date >= '2022-06-01'
ORDER BY invoice_total DESC
```

### Full Outer Join

A combination of left outer join and right outer join.

There is no keywords in MySQL to do full outer join directly. Other SQL dialects might have (e.g. T-SQL has FULL (OUTER) JOIN)

in MySQL it is literally a UNION of LEFT JOIN set and RIGHT JOIN set

```{sql}
SELECT department_name AS dept_name,
        d.department_number AS d_dept_no,
        e.department_number AS e_dept_no, last_name
FROM ex.departments d 
     LEFT JOIN ex.employees e 
     ON d.department_number = e.department_number

UNION

SELECT department_name AS dept_name,
       d.department_number AS d_dept_no,
       e.department_number AS e_dept_no, last_name
FROM ex.departments d 
    RIGHT JOIN ex.employees e 
    ON d.department_number = e.department_number

ORDER BY dept_name
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dbDisconnect(conn)
```
